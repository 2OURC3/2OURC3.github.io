    <body><div class='page'><h1 class='title'>IDA</h1><br/>The Interactive Disassembler (IDA) is a disassembler for computer software which generates assembly language source code from machine-executable code. It <br />supports a variety of executable formats for different processors and operating systems. It also can be used as a debugger for Windows PE, Mac OS X Mach-O, and <br />Linux ELF executables.<br /><br /> A decompiler plug-in for programs compiled with a C/C++ compiler is available at extra cost. The latest full version of IDA Pro is commercial, <br />while an earlier and less capable version is available for download free of charge (version 7.6 as of March 2021)</div></body></html>
